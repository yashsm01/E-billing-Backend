				share Personal Information with other companies with your consent or as part of a specific program or
				feature provided in partnership with a third party. If you choose to participate in such program or feature,
				we authorize those third parties to use your Personal Information. For example, we make offers on or through
				our Services that require you to fill out an advertiser survey in order to receive the coupon. If you choose
				to participate in the survey, then we will share the information you provide with the advertiser who
				provided the survey. You may also be given the option to sign up for promotional emails from a third party.
				In order to fulfill your request, we will provide your email address to the applicable third party. In

	<p class="western" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Ubuntu, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">(d) We may

				a specific individual (such as a cryptographic hash of an email address, certain cookies, age, gender,
				household income, interests, geographic location, coupon activation and redemption data, purchase data, and
				other automatically collected information) with third parties for advertising and promotional use. A third
				party may match such information with information you have previously provided to that party, or other
				information that party has obtained. We also may share information that does not specifically identify you
				with third parties that use cookies or other similar technologies on our Sites so that they can tailor
				advertisements or offers to your apparent interests and deliver those advertisements or offers to you while
				you are either using our Services or on third-party websites. For example, if you use a pet food offer, then
				we may conclude that you have a pet and show you a pet care supply advertisement instead of a random
